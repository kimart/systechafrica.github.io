## Creating User Accounts

The user accounts are individual or personal logging in accounts for the system
users. The user accounts are assigned to specific created profiles which define
the permissions to which the user is assigned to access specific system modules
functions.

## Existing Users

Clicking the **Existing Users** link will open a new page listing all system
users in the system and their specific details. From this page a user can add
new users and edit existing users’ details among other actions. See screenshot
below:

## Adding a New User

Clicking the **New User button** labeled 1 will open a new user details form. To
successfully create a new user, the fields marked with a red asterisk must be
filled by typing the details or selecting from drop-down menus in some fields.

**Note:** selecting the appropriate profile is key because users in FundMaster
are categorized into profiles which are basically groups with different access
privileges in the system.

Scrolling down the form, the modules which the new user is only allowed to
access can be determined at this level. See screenshot below:
