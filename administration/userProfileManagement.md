## Profiles

A profile in FundMaster denotes a group of users with specific privileges in the
system. The system supports profiling of users and by default creates a **System
Administrator Profile** from which other profiles are created.

Profiles store specific users or group of users with different roles, for
example management profile, pension administration and others as will be
demonstrated in this section.

## Profiles Register

Clicking the **Profiles** link will open profile grid table listing profiles
created in the system to date. A user can browse through the list, create a new
profile, view details of a selected profile and remove a profile from the system
as shown in the screenshot below:

## Enabling Profile Permissions

Once a profile is created, the next step is to allow access to certain functions
in the system to a newly created profile. The permissions given enables the new
profile to access system modules and rights to certain functions in an
individual module.

## Profile Permissions

Clicking the **Profiles Permission** link will open profiles permission grid
table where permissions are assigned to profiles. The table provides drop-down
menus to choose profiles and the modules whose permissions are to be assigned to
a profile among others as shown below:
