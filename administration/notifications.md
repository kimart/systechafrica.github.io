## Notification Introduction

FundMaster communicates from within the system and without through an advanced
notification system through emails, SMS, or both. The system allows an
administrator to configure notification matrix (i.e., what key system activities
need notifications) and setup a template which will be used as email format for
sending messages to target audience concerning a particular issue, say password
reset.

## Notification Configuration Matrix

Clicking the Notifications link labeled 3 in the previous screenshot will
display a drop-down menu from which the **Notifications Config Matrix** link can
be accessed. Clicking this link will display a Send Notifications Form where a
user is allowed to select the key events, activities for which notifications
messages ought to be sent.

Check the **Yes** or **No** checkbox on the listed items enclosed under **label
1**, otherwise choose whether to make the configurations global or not under
text box **labeled** 2. See screenshot below:

**Action**

-   Check the appropriate checkbox â€“ **Yes** or **No** under the encloser
    **labeled 1** on the form to determine which action to send notification on.

-   Click to select **Yes** or **No** in the drop-down menu **labeled 2** to
    determine the scope of application of the configurations.

-   Click the **Save** button to confirm the configurations, otherwise close the
    form.

## Creating Notification Templates

FundMaster allows administrators to design notifications template in such a way
that instead of writing a notification to every recipient individually, key
words (e.g., member name) are embedded in a message and broadcast to all
members. On the screenshot below, see a grid table listing available templates.
