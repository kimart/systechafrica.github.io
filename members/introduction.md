### Scheme Data Importation

**Prerequisites**

For efficient upload of members details, their beneficiaries, contributions, and opening balances into a new scheme setup in FundMaster, a scheme administrator will need templates populated with data to be provided before hard. Such includes:  

-   **Member details template:** this template generally contains members’ personal details with three unique Columns: **Member number**, **Member Class code** and **Cost Center code**.

-   **Beneficiary details template**: This template generally contains the beneficiaries’ personal details with one unique column, the Member number column which attaches a beneficiary to specific member.

-   **Opening balances templates:** These consist of two like templates: the registered and the unregistered opening balances templates. Each of the templates have general balances amounts but with a unique member number column. The member number column attaches the balances to specific members.

-   **Member contributions template:** This template generally has the members’ contributions and salary but contain a unique member number column which ties the amounts to a specific member.

There are **two ways** in which you can upload member data into FundMaster’s Member Register:

**1.**  A single member can be added by filling in details in a member’s details form. The added member must then be approved via the **Member Approval** to officially be saved in the members register.

**2.**  More than one member added in batch using a template file (e.g., MS Excel) which is filled with the members details and then imported into the system.
